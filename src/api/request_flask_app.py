An air-quality research facility monitors the quality of the air and alerts of possible high air pollution in a region. The facility receives event data from 25,000 sensors every 60 seconds. Event data is then used for time-series analysis per region. Cloud experts suggested using BigTable for storing event data.
What will you design the row key for each even in BigTable?

A. Use eventâ€™s timestamp as row key.
B. Use combination of sensor ID with timestamp as sensorID-timestamp.
C. Use combination of sensor ID with timestamp as timestamp-sensorID.
D. Use sensor ID as row key.
